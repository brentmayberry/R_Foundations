## This tutorial describes how to manipulate data with data.table R package. 
## It is considered as the fastest R package for data wrangling. 
## Analysts generally call R programming not compatible with big datasets ( > 10 GB) 
### as it is not memory efficient and loads everything into RAM. 
## To change their perception, 'data.table' package comes into play. 
## This package was designed to be concise and painless. 
## There are many benchmarks done in the past to compare dplyr vs data.table. 
## In every benchmark, data.table wins. 
## The efficiency of this package was also compared with python' package (panda). 
## And data.table wins. 
## In CRAN, there are more than 200 packages that are dependent on data.table 
### which makes it listed in the top 5 R's package.
